# Stable vs Unstable Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the order of two items with the same value does not change after sorting

Stable: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort
Unstable: Heap Sort, Quick Sort

# When to use

- Insertion Sort: when there are only a few items in the list (really fast when the list is small and almost sorted)
- Bubble Sort: rarely used in real life
- Selection Sort: rarely used in real life
- Merge Sort: good if you are worried about worst case, not very good in terms of space complexity (O(n))
- Quick Sort: Good for most cases, unless worst case
