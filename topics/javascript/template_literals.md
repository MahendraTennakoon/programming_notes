- string literals(fixed values) that allow embedded expressiions
- multi line strings and string interpolation(evaluating string literals with placeholders) features can be used
- were called "template strings" in prior editions of ES2015
- template literals are enclosed by the back-tick(\`) character instead of double or single quotes
